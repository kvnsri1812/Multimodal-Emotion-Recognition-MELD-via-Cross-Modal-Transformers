A high-performance, production-grade multimodal deep learning pipeline designed for Conversational Emotion Recognition (ERC). This system integrates **Linguistic (BERT)**, **Acoustic (Wav2Vec2)**, and **Visual (ViT)** signals using a custom cross-modal fusion architecture to classify emotions in multi-party dialogues.

## 🚀 Executive Summary & Key Results

Following 5 epochs of staged fine-tuning on the highly imbalanced MELD dataset, the system achieved the following metrics on the unseen test set:

| Metric | Score | Performance Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | **59.96%** | Highly competitive baseline for 7-class imbalanced real-world data. |
| **Weighted F1** | **60.66%** | Demonstrates robust precision/recall balance across primary classes. |
| **Macro F1** | **44.72%** | Significantly improved via dynamic Class-Weighted Loss optimization. |

## System Architecture

The model implements a **Late Fusion Transformer** approach. Instead of simple vector concatenation, it projects modality-specific features into a shared embedding space ($d=768$) and utilizes a Transformer Encoder to learn complex inter-modality correlations.

### Foundation Encoders
* **Text:** `bert-base-uncased` — Extracts semantic and contextual linguistic features.
* **Audio:** `facebook/wav2vec2-base` — Extracts acoustic properties and prosody from raw 16kHz waveforms.
* **Vision:** `google/vit-base-patch16-224` — Processes sampled video frames via Vision Transformer spatiotemporal patches.

### Fusion Logic
The system uses a **4-layer Transformer Encoder** (8 attention heads) to perform cross-modal reasoning. This allows the network to dynamically weigh, for example, the importance of a specific spoken word against a micro-expression or vocal tone. The output is mean-pooled and passed through an MLP classifier with Dropout ($0.3$).

## Engineering Highlights

* **Mixed Precision Training (AMP):** Utilizes `torch.amp.GradScaler` to optimize GPU memory footprint and increase throughput, critical for training large multimodal networks on consumer-grade hardware.
* **Staged Fine-Tuning Strategy:** To stabilize training, the system uses a 2-epoch "Encoder Freeze." The cross-modal fusion head is warmed up first, followed by full-model unfreezing to refine the foundation backbone weights without catastrophic forgetting.
* **Cached Tensor Preprocessing:** Decouples heavy media decoding (OpenCV/Librosa) from the training loop. Converting raw video/audio into serialized `.pt` files results in near-zero data-loading bottlenecks during GPU execution.
* **Class Imbalance Mitigation:** Automatically computes class weights from the training distribution to scale the `CrossEntropyLoss`, ensuring minority target variables (e.g., Disgust, Fear) receive proportional gradient updates.

## Installation & Usage

### 1. Requirements
Ensure you are running Python 3.10+ and have a CUDA-enabled GPU.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Preprocessing
Before training, run the preprocessing script to extract and cache all modality features. **This only needs to be run once.**
```bash
python preprocess.py
```

### 3. Training & Evaluation
Execute the main script. This handles the staged unfreezing, AMP training loop, model checkpointing, and final test set evaluation.
```bash
python main.py
```

## Ablation Study Support
The architecture is designed for modularity. You can toggle modalities in `model.py` to validate the effectiveness of the cross-modal fusion:
```python
# Example: Audio-Visual only (Ablating Text)
model = MultiModalModel(use_text=False, use_audio=True, use_vision=True)
```
